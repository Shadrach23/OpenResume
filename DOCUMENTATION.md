}>({} as any);

export const ResumeProvider: React.FC<{ children: React.ReactNode }> = ({ children }) => {
  const [resumeData, setResumeData] = useState<Resume>(defaultResumeData);
  
  // Load saved data from localStorage on initial render
  useEffect(() => {
    const loadSavedData = async () => {
      try {
        const savedData = await localforage.getItem<Resume>('resumeData');
        if (savedData) {
          setResumeData(savedData);
        }
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error loading saved resume data:', error);
      }
    };
    
    loadSavedData();
  }, []);
  
  // Save data to localStorage whenever it changes
  useEffect(() => {
    const saveData = async () => {
      try {
        await localforage.setItem('resumeData', resumeData);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error saving resume data:', error);
      }
    };
    
    saveData();
  }, [resumeData]);
  
  // Update entire resume data or specific sections
  const updateResumeData = useCallback((data: Partial<Resume>) => {
    setResumeData(prev => ({ ...prev, ...data }));
  }, []);
  
  const updateSection = useCallback((section: string, data: any) => {
    setResumeData(prev => ({
      ...prev,
      [section]: data
    }));
  }, []);
  
  // Add new item to a section array
  const addItem = useCallback((section: string) => {
    setResumeData(prev => {
      if (Array.isArray(prev[section])) {
        return {
          ...prev,
          [section]: [...prev[section], getDefaultItem(section)]
        };
      }
      return prev;
    });
  }, []);
  
  // Remove item from a section array
  const removeItem = useCallback((section: string, index: number) => {
    setResumeData(prev => {
      if (Array.isArray(prev[section])) {
        return {
          ...prev,
          [section]: prev[section].filter((_, i) => i !== index)
        };
      }
      return prev;
    });
  }, []);
  
  // Move item within a section array (drag and drop reordering)
  const moveItem = useCallback((section: string, fromIndex: number, toIndex: number) => {
    setResumeData(prev => {
      if (Array.isArray(prev[section])) {
        const newItems = [...prev[section]];
        const [movedItem] = newItems.splice(fromIndex, 1);
        newItems.splice(toIndex, 0, movedItem);
        return {
          ...prev,
          [section]: newItems

      </div>
      
      {/* Additional form sections (Education, Skills, etc.) */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

**Resume Preview Component**
```typescript
const ResumePreview: React.FC = () => {
  const { resumeData } = useContext(ResumeContext);
  const { template } = resumeData.settings;
  
  // Render different templates based on selection
  const renderTemplate = () => {
    switch (template) {
      case 'modern':
        return <ModernTemplate resumeData={resumeData} />;
      case 'professional':
        return <ProfessionalTemplate resumeData={resumeData} />;
      case 'minimal':
        return <MinimalTemplate resumeData={resumeData} />;
      default:
        return <ModernTemplate resumeData={resumeData} />;
    }
  };
  
  return (
    <div className="resume-preview">
      <div className="preview-container">
        {renderTemplate()}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### Resume Parser Implementation

```typescript
const parseResume = async (file: File): Promise<Partial<Resume>> => {
  try {
    // For PDF files
    if (file.type === 'application/pdf') {
      const arrayBuffer = await file.arrayBuffer();
      const pdf = await pdfjsLib.getDocument({ data: arrayBuffer }).promise;
      
      let fullText = '';
      
      // Extract text from all pages
      for (let i = 1; i <= pdf.numPages; i++) {
        const page = await pdf.getPage(i);
        const textContent = await page.getTextContent();
        const pageText = textContent.items
          .map((item: any) => item.str)
          .join(' ');
        
        fullText += pageText + '\n';
      }
      
      // Process extracted text to identify sections and content
      return processResumeText(fullText);
    }
    
    // For DOCX files (implementation would vary)
    if (file.type === 'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document') {
      // DOCX parsing implementation
    }
    
    throw new Error('Unsupported file type');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error parsing resume:', error);
    throw error;
  }
};

// Process extracted text to identify resume sections and content
const processResumeText = (text: string): Partial<Resume> => {
  const result: Partial<Resume> = {
    basics: {},
    experience: [],
    education: [],
    skills: []
  };
  
  // Extract basic information (name, email, phone)
  const emailMatch = text.match(/[\w.-]+@[\w.-]+\.[\w.-]+/);
  if (emailMatch) {
    result.basics.email = emailMatch[0];
  }
  
  const phoneMatch = text.match(/\(\d{3}\)\s*\d{3}[-.\s]\d{4}|\d{3}[-.\s]\d{3}[-.\s]\d{4}/);
  if (phoneMatch) {
    result.basics.phone = phoneMatch[0];
  }
  
  // More complex parsing logic for experience, education, etc.
  // This would involve pattern matching and NLP techniques
  
  return result;
};
```

#### PDF Export Implementation

```typescript
const generatePDF = async (resumeData: Resume): Promise<Blob> => {
  // Create a new PDF document
  const doc = new jsPDF({
    orientation: resumeData.settings.orientation || 'portrait',
    unit: 'mm',
    format: resumeData.settings.paperSize || 'a4'
  });
  
  // Get the HTML element containing the resume preview
  const element = document.getElementById('resume-preview-container');
  
  if (!element) {
    throw new Error('Resume preview element not found');
  }
  
  // Convert HTML to canvas
  const canvas = await html2canvas(element, {
    scale: 2, // Higher scale for better quality
    useCORS: true,
    logging: false
  });
  
  const imgData = canvas.toDataURL('image/jpeg', 1.0);
  
  // Calculate dimensions to fit the page
  const imgProps = doc.getImageProperties(imgData);
  const pdfWidth = doc.internal.pageSize.getWidth();
  const pdfHeight = (imgProps.height * pdfWidth) / imgProps.width;
  
  // Add the image to the PDF
  doc.addImage(imgData, 'JPEG', 0, 0, pdfWidth, pdfHeight);
  
  // Return as blob
  return doc.output('blob');
};
```
